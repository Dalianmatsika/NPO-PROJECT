                        <p>Founded in 2010 by local residents, The Giving Tree has grown from a small volunteer-run food bank into a multi-faceted non-profit organisation. Our mission is to nurture a thriving and connected community by providing accessible resources, fostering personal growth, and creating a supportive environment for all. We envision a community where every individual has the support and resources they need to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.</p>
                        <h3>Our Team</h3>
                        <p>We are a small but passionate team of staff and volunteers dedicated to serving our community. Our leadership is comprised of long-time residents and experts in social work, education, and community development.</p>
