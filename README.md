# Project Overview:
Multi-Page Structure: The website is organized into multiple HTML files (Homepage.html, about.html, programs.html, events.html, volunteer.html, donate.html, blog.html, and contact.html).
External Stylesheet: All styling is managed from a single style.css file for easy maintenance and a consistent look and feel.
esponsive Design: The layout, typography, and images are optimized for a seamless viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
Clear Navigation: A sticky header with clear navigation links and call-to-action buttons ensures users can easily find the information they need.
Modern UI/UX: The design incorporates soft colors, rounded corners, and subtle hover effects to create an engaging and professional aesthetic.

# Changelog
September 26, 2025: Final Polish & Resiliency
Improved User Experience (UX) with Image Fallbacks: Added onerror handlers (using placehold.co) to all inline images, ensuring that placeholder images display gracefully if original file paths fail, preventing broken visual elements.

Updated Footer Styling: Refactored the <footer> using new Tailwind classes (bg-gray-800, mt-auto) to create a dark, polished, and persistent footer that always sticks to the bottom of the page.

Navigation Hover Update: Adjusted navigation link hover colors to use a slightly darker gray (hover:text-gray-900) for a more subtle contrast.

September 24, 2025: Team Section Redesign
Implemented Responsive Team Grid: Introduced new custom CSS classes (.team-grid-css, .team-member-css) to create a modern, responsive grid layout for the "Meet Our Team" section. This automatically adapts card size based on screen width.

Styled Team Member Cards: Applied box shadows, padding, background color (--medium-gray), and defined circular images for all team photos to enhance visual appeal.

Content Update: Updated team member names in the content (e.g., Jane Doe, John Smith, Maria Garcia).

September 21, 2025: Layout & Structural Refinements
Centralized Content Container: Added a dedicated custom CSS utility class, .container-css, to manage the maximum width and center content across the main body sections, ensuring a professional and readable layout on large screens.

Dynamic Main Content Sizing: Applied the flex-grow utility to the <main> element to ensure it correctly expands, working in concert with the new fixed footer.

Standardized Typography: Enforced centered alignment and consistent coloring for all main headings (h1, h2, h3) using the newly defined primary color.

September 18, 2025: Styling Architecture & Readability
Established Design Tokens (CSS Variables): Defined a set of root CSS variables (e.g., --primary-color, --dark-color, --border-radius) within the <style> block to standardize colors and spacing across the page.

Increased Base Readability: The default font size for the <body> was increased from 16px to 18px to improve overall text readability and accessibility.

Font Pairing: Explicitly set different font families for the body text ('Roboto', sans-serif) and headings ('Merriweather', serif) for visual hierarchy.

# Part 2 Details:
This the assignment was centered on transforming the site from a basic structure into a polished, accessible, and resilient resource by:
1.Establishing a Design System: Implementing CSS variables (design tokens) and standardized typography for visual consistency.
2.Enhancing Layout: Creating fully responsive structures using custom containers, flex controls, and a CSS Grid for sections like the team directory.
3.Improving User Experience (UX): Boosting accessibility by increasing the base font size and adding technical resilience through essential image fallback mechanisms (onerror handlers).
